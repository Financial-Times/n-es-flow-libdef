# n-flow-ft-content

Flow type definition for a piece of FT content, as represented in Elastic Search. Automatically generated on publish from the ES mappings.

## Usage

`npm install @financial-times/n-flow-ft-content`, then in a Flow-activated repo you can `import type {FtItem} from '@financial-times/n-flow-ft-content'`.

## Using Flow in your project

Add `flow-bin` as a dependency of your project. Create an empty [`.flowconfig`](https://flow.org/en/docs/config/) file at the root of your project (e.g. by running `flow init`).

If you don't want to introduce a build step for your code, use the [Flow comment syntax](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/comments/). Otherwise, install either `babel-preset-flow` or `flow-remove-types` and add it to your build process.

Run `flow check` as part of your CI tests, and maybe in a `precommit` hook. Encourage your developers to add a Flow integration to their editor.
